# Eye Exercise
We were given some starter code in this file that challenged us to replicate the capabilities of a single eye, which tracked mouse movements, and create a second eye that could perform the same task with finesse.

#####  To Run: Simply upload the code to a blank browser, and you'll be greeted by two eyes on the screen. With the mouse cursor as your guide, watch in as the pupils of these eyes dutifully follow your every move.
